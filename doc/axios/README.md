# React with Axios

Let's delve into the most common obstacles `by Arash Yeganeh`.

## What is Axios?

Axios is a JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from web browsers or Node.js servers. It simplifies the process of sending and receiving data over the internet, providing an easy-to-use interface for handling asynchronous operations like fetching data from APIs.

## Features

* **Promise-Based**
  Axios uses promises to handle asynchronous operations, making it easy to write code that is both concise and readable.

* **Simple API**
  Axios provides a clean and intuitive API for making various types of HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

* **Request and Response Interceptors**
  Interceptors can be used to modify requests or responses globally before they are sent or received. This can be useful for adding authentication headers, logging, or modifying data.

* **Request and Response Configuration**
  You can configure request headers, timeout settings, and other parameters to customize your requests and responses.

* **Cancellation**
  Axios allows you to cancel ongoing requests using cancellation tokens, helping to manage network requests in complex scenarios.

* **Error Handling**
  Axios provides a structured way to handle errors, making it easier to differentiate between network errors, server errors, and other issues.

* **Concurrent Requests**
  Axios supports performing multiple requests concurrently, allowing for efficient data fetching.

* **Promise Chaining**
  Axios supports promise chaining, enabling you to perform multiple asynchronous operations in sequence.

* **Global Configuration**
  You can set global configuration options for Axios, such as default headers or base URLs, simplifying the setup of multiple requests.

## Installing
